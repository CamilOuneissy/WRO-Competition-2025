The Open challenge is where the car must complete three full laps around the field without touching a wall. The size of each side of the field is determined by judges randomly of either 100 cm or 60 cm. The direction that the car drives in is also completly randomized (clockwize or counterclockwize).

#### 2- The Obstacle Chalenge
In the obstacle challenge the car must complete three full laps around the field, without touching the different coloured traffic signs (Red or green pillars). If the pillar is red, the car should pass on its right side, and if the pillar is green, the car should pass on its left side. The direction that the car drives in is also completly randomized (clockwize or counterclockwize).
After the third lap, depending on the last pillar, the car must continue in the same direction or change directions to find the parking lot. The car must then back into the parking lot without touching either of the ends. The size of each side of the field remains constant, 1 metre for each side.
