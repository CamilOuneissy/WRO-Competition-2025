# The Electromechanical Schemes
## The raspberry py:
Connected to the Raspberry we have: <br>
1- The camera (A web cam connected via a USB cable) <br>
2-The servo motor(MG995) <br>
3-A 12 volts DC motor connected via a LN298 motor driver. <br>
4-Two Ultra sonic sensors (HR-SR04) <br>
# The battery
For power, a (20V;4A) battery is connected to a step down converter to give precisely 5V to the raspberry, 5v to the bread board, and 12v to the L298N Driver. The GND ports are all connected to the bread port and the respberry py GND or the step down converter GND.
